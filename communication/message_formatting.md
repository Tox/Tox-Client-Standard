Message Formatting
------------------

- **3.5.1** ![](/badge/req.png) A client must encode emoticons as Unicode emoji.

- **3.5.2** ![](/badge/req.png) A receiving client will make a best-effort to display
  text exactly as it was intended, and must not materially change the text in any way.
    - The above rule does not apply if malformed UTF-8 text is received. In
      this case, a client may transform the text to any extent necessary to
      make it displayable.
    - A material change is any change that likely will change the structure, layout,
      content, meaning, text, or intent of the message.

- **5.3.3** ![](/badge/rec.png) It's a strong suggestion that messaging clients support 
  at the very least a subset of the common markdown syntax. The markdown used in this 
  standard is a subset of Github Flavored Markdown. With the exclusion of direct 
  links/referneces.
    - ![](/badge/req.png) If the client implments any kind of markdown support, it must 
      not conflict in any way with the markdown used in this standard.
    - This Flavor of markdown was chosen because of it's protection of common code syntax.
    - Clients are free to implement any subset or different markdown or markdown like syntax
      given it doesn't conflict with this standard.

- **3.5.4** ![](/badge/req.png) A sending client must not insert or remove any content/data
  from any message, of any type. Clients may trim extraneous white space (except for 
  carriage returns and new lines) from messages. Messages may not be altered in any other way.

- **3.5.5** ![](/badge/req.png) Sent messages must be strictly compatible with UTF-8.
