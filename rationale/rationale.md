Rationale
============

The purpose of the rationale is to expound on clauses for which the purpose may
be confusing or unobvious. The criteria for including a clause in this document
is somewhat arbitrary; inclusion is decided on a case by case basis, usually in
response to questions or confusion within the Tox development community.

- **1.0.2** If a user's client is configured to use a proxy, it is reasonable
  to assume that the user may be attempting to mask their IP address.
  Therefore, users must be made aware that UDP traffic may bypass the proxy and
  reveal their IP address.

- **1.0.3** If a user's client is configured to use a proxy with UDP
  connections disabled, it must be assumed that the user's intent is to mask
  their IP address. Therefore, it should not be possible to bypass the proxy.

- **1.0.4** Third-party services cannot be accounted for by the Tox Project and
  are contrary to the decentralized nature of Tox. They may be unreliable,
  insecure, or otherwise compromised. Therefore the user should always have the
  option to use the client in a fully functional manner (with respect to the
  functionality made available via the Tox API) without being forced to use
  third party services.

- **2.3.3** PNG images are currently the only image type supported by the Tox
  core library.

- **2.3.10** This will ensure that the avatar is unset for all of the user's
  friends (as long as their clients comply with the avatar protocol as
  described in this document).

- **3.1.1** When a friend request is accepted, certain identifying information
  may become available to initiator of the request. To protect user privacy,
  this must not occur without the user's explicit consent.

- **3.1.2** This provides a way for users to verify the identity of the
  requestor out-of-band (e.g. over the phone or in person) before accepting the
  request.

- **3.2.2** When a user joins a group, certain identifying information may
  become available to all peers in the group. To protect user privacy,
  this must not occur without the user's explicit consent.

- **3.2.3** A peer's identity in a group, which includes their group public key
  and role/permissions, is persistent across client restarts. However, this
  identity is permanently lost when the client explicitly leaves the group.

- **4.0.2** As message history may be stored on a user's device in plaintext,
  it is a matter of security to ensure that this does not occur without the
  user's explicit consent.

- **5.0.1** The .tox data file contains all of the information required to steal
  a user's identity. Therefore users should always have and be aware of the
  option to encrypt this file.
